Hello! My name is Michael Shara - I am an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student and researcher interested in developing medical devices and treatments that provide innovative surgical, therapeutic, and diagnostic techniques. Eager to advance patient care through collaborative research and hands-on clinical experience. Actively seeking opportunities to learn, contribute, and build skills at the intersection of engineering and medicine, with a strong focus on gaining clinical experience to support my goal of applying to medical school.
