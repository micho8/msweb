## Abstract:

The goal in to design electronics for a wearable heart-rate sensor that is small sized and incorporates wireless data transfer.

## Considerations:

To begin, I will look at low power consumption techniques for my circuit. It is very important that for wearable device that uses a battery inside of the housing since I don't want the battery to drain in one day.


I will design a circuit to extract the data wirelessly using the sensing of the body through the electronic devices.


It is also important that I design a small footprint for the device.

## Low Power Consumption:

The goal is to optimize the capacity that is tied to the size of the battery.
